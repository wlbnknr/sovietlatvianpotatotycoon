# Soviet Latvian Potato Tycoon

- Dig potatoes for glory of kolkhoz.
- Eat potato soup to stave off starvation.
- Exploit peasants after accumulating sufficient potato capital.
- Enjoy the tragedy.

Versions 001-003 were my first attempts whatsoever at creating a game with a simple loop and victory/loss conditions. Version 004 is more playable and better rounded, although the earlier iterations are (kind of) funnier as a trilogy.
